"Production" is a representation of producing items.
For example, laying eggs, milking can be interpreted as "Production"
So, you can add various productions using this config.


PRODUCTIONS
-----------
[
    $production$,
    $production$,
    ...
]


$production$
------------
$milk$
OR
$egg$
OR
$shear$
------------
A type production like $milk$, $egg$, or $shear$ is distinguished by "type" field.
Every production must have "name" which is used to save data to disc.
This "name" must be unique.


$milk$
------
{
    "type" : "milk",
    "name" : $String$,
    "delay" : $range$,
    "should_adult" : $Boolean$,
    "disable_sound" : $Boolean$,
    "input" : $ItemStack$,
    "output" : $ItemStack$
}
------
Milk production is way of producing milk like Cow.
You can specify "bucket" as "input", "milk" as "output".
Additionally, you can also set "delay", "should_adult", "disable_sound"
* There's no limitation on "input"/"output", you can specify anything.


$egg$
-----
{
    "type" : "egg",
    "name" : $String$,
    "delay" : $range$,
    "should_adult" : $Boolean$,
    "disable_sound" : $Boolean$,
    "output" : $ItemStack$,
}
-----
Egg production is way of producing egg like Chicken.
You can specify "egg" as "output".
Additionally, you can also set "delay", "should_adult", "disable_sound"
* There's no limitation on "output", you can specify anything.


$shear$
-------
{
    "type" : "shear",
    "name" : $String$,
    "delay" : $range$,
    "should_adult" : $Boolean$,
    "disable_sound" : $Boolean$,
    "damage" : $Integer$,
    "input" : $ItemStack$,
    "output" : $ItemStack$
}
-------
Shearing production is way of producing wool like Sheep.
You can specify "wool" as "output", "shears" as "input".
"damage" determines durability cost per shearing.
* There's no limitation on "output", you can specify anything.
  For "input", it must be damagable, like equipment.


EXAMPLE
{
    "type" : "shear",
    "name" : "minecraft.llama.shear",
    "delay" : {
        "min" : 15,
        "max" : 30
    },
    "should_adult" : true,
    "disable_sound" : false,
    "damage" : 2,
    "input" : {
    	"item" : "minecraft:shears"
    },
    "output" : {
    	"item" : "minecraft:string"
    }
}
------
This production above, produces string from llama with shears.


$range$
-------
$Integer$
OR
{
    "min" : $Integer$,
    "max" : $Integer$
}

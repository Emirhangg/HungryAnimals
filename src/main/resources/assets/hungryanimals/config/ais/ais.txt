AI of an animal is defined by a AI container and AI modifiers.
AI containers decide category of AI, like "herbivore" or "wolf".
AI modifiers change details of AI container. AI modifiers are applicable to specific AI containers.

"herbivore" : should be set to herbivores.
              removes Vanilla AIs such like being tempted, mating, eating grass.

"rabbit" : almost as same as "herbivore",
           removes Vanilla AIs specialized to rabbit.

"wolf" : should be set to carnivores.
         removes Vanilla AIs mentioned above, and hunting.

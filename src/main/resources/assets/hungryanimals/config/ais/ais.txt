AI is a set of instructions to decide animals' behavior.

'ais/modid#animal.json'
---------------------
{
    "type" : $ai_type$,
    $ai_name$ : $ai_parameters$,
    $ai_name$ : $ai_parameters$,
    ...
}


$ai_type$
---------------------
"herbivore" OR "rabbit" OR "wolf"


List of possible $ai_name$ depends on $ai_type$

"herbivore"'s $ai_name$
---------------------
"attack_melee" OR
"avoid_player" OR
"mate" OR
"trough" OR
"tempt" OR
"tempt_edible" OR
"eat_item" OR
"eat_block" OR
"hurt_by_player"


"rabbit"'s $ai_name$
---------------------
as same as "herbivore"'s $ai_name$
will be deprecated soon


"wolf"'s $ai_name$
---------------------
"mate" OR
"trough" OR
"tempt_edible" OR
"eat_item" OR
"eat_block" OR
"hunt_non_tamed" OR
"hunt"


$ai_name$ : $ai_parameters$ pair refers a minimal set of instructions that have meaning.
For example, "mate" is an AI to let animals mate when they are full.
"mate"'s $ai_parameters$ decides movement speed of animals while mating.
Therefore $ai_parameters$'s content is depends on $ai_name$.

    
"attack_melee" : attacks target. This AI requires another targeting AI like "hurt_by_player"
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
        "use_long_memory" : if true, the animals will keep attacking target even if the animals can not reach the target
    }
    
"avoid_player" : flees from player (wild animals only)
    {
        "radius" : flee when distance to the player is less than "radius"
        "farspeed" : movement speed when distance to the player is more than 7m 
        "nearspeed" : movement speed when distance to the player is less than 7m
    }
   
"mate" : mates with other animal
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
    }
    
"trough" : eats item inside trough
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
    }
    
"tempt" : tempted by items listed.
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
        "scared_by" : if true, the animal stop to be tempted when the player moves.
        "items" : list of Ingredients (possible one Ingredient)
    }

"tempt_edible" : tempted by edible items (food preferences)
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
        "scared_by" : if true, the animal stop to be tempted when the player moves.
    }

"eat_item" : eats fallen items
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
    }

"eat_block" : eats blocks
    {
        "speed" : movement speed
    }

"hurt_by_player" : targets the attacker (player only), this target is used by "attack_melee"
    {
        "call_help" : if true, animals nearby target the attacker, too.
    }

"hunt_non_tamed" : hunts animals (food preferences) when hungry, when not tamed (in Vanilla). This AI can not be used with "hunt"
    {
        "chance" : how frequently it hunts (1 -> 100%, 10 -> 10% ...)
        "check_sight" : if true, only hunts animals in sight
        "only_nearby" : if true, only hunts animals nearby
        "herding" : if true, hunts with other carnivores nearby
    }
    
"hunt" : hunts animals (food preferences) when hungry. This AI can not be used with "hunt"
    {
        "chance" : how frequently it hunts (1 -> 100%, 10 -> 10% ...)
        "check_sight" : if true, only hunts animals in sight
        "only_nearby" : if true, only hunts animals nearby
        "herding" : if true, hunts with other carnivores nearby
    }
